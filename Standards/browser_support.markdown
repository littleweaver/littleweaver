# Browser Support

Little Weaver has carefully considered the browsers we support based on a variety of factors.
We must ensure we provide the most value to clients and their visitors during development time.
This support is based on our experience from a multitude of projects, the latest browser usage statistics from authoritative sources, and the standards of the tech community from projects such as [Bootstrap](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/).
