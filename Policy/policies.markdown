Little Weaver Web Collective, LLC Policies
==========================================


Work
----

Each member must work a minimum of 20 hours per two-week pay period.
Work hours include:

* work for clients,
* Collective projects,
* blog posts,
* relevant professional development (e.g., learning new software),
* and work on Collective infrastructure and overhead.

Members may not work more than 60 hours per week, because life outside of work is also important.

Pay periods are two weeks long, starting on a Monday and ending on a Sunday.
Pay periods are a part of the fiscal year in which they end.

Each pay period contains 10 work days and 4 weekend days.
On weekend days, members are not expected to be available, but also are not prohibited from working.
Members should notify the Collective when their weekend days and work days are arranged such that not all weekend days are Saturdays and Sundays.
It is preferable that this be done at the end of the preceding pay period, but marking on the calendar the day the change takes effect is sufficient.


### Vacation

Starting in 2016, each member receives 26 vacation days per year.
Vacation days are recorded per pay period, in increments no finer than half-days.
It is preferable that use of vacation days be announced at least one month in advance, and that vacation days be assigned to specific work days when a member will not be working, but this is not required.
In the last pay period of the year, any unused vacation days will automatically be added to that pay period.

Each day of vacation taken by a given member counts as 6 hours of work.

When considering whether a member has worked the minimum number of hours required in a pay period, an additional 2 hours per vacation day taken that pay period will be added to the number of real hours worked, because that is the mean number of hours per day required to meet the minimum.


### Pay

All members will be paid the same hourly rate of $25 USD per hour worked.
Work in excess of 40 hours in a week will be paid at a rate of 1.5 times the current rate of pay.


Client Work
-----------

### Rates

Rates will be negotiated with every client and written into their contract.
Retained hours will be billed at a 20% discount.
Emergency hours (as defined in the contract) are billed at 125% of the standard rate.
By default, most work qualifies for these rates, including time spent writing emails, giving trainings, and attending meetings.
Time spent before the start of a contract and time spent invoicing will not be billed unless specified in a contract.
Code running on a production server will never be intentionally modified or upgraded without a contract.

### Open Source

We require that clients agree that we may contribute to existing open-source projects as part of our work for the client.
We require further that clients allow us to open-source as much of the code written for them as is reasonable.


Process for New Membership
--------------------------

Prospective members will work for a minimum of 12 weeks in a trial membership period.
They will have the rights and requirements specified below:

- They will be required to work a minimum of 20 hours per two-week pay period.
- They will be paid as contractors at the same rate as members.
- They will be expected to attend business meetings as members are.
- After the first month, they will be expected to participate in decision-making (Thursday) meetings. (Prior to that, they may only participate if specifically invited.)
- Their contributions in meetings will be taken seriously, but their approval will not be *required* for decisions.

The existing membership will meet within two weeks of the end of the trial period to determine whether to accept the prospective member as a member of the Collective.
The prospective member may make a statement of their interest in joining the Collective, but it is not a requirement.

If the prospective member is not accepted by the Collective, the collective *may* offer them the opportunity to continue working as a prospective member, and be reconsidered for membership after another 12 weeks.
This is to be used in instances when it is still not clear whether Little Weaver and the prospective member are a good fit after the first trial period and more time is needed to assess.
This cannot be renewed for a consecutive third trial period, i.e., a person may only be a prospective member for up to 24 weeks.


Contractors
-----------

Little Weaver may sometimes wish to enlist non-members to do some work for the collective.
These non-members will be contractors for Little Weaver, will not have the rights or responsibilities of members, and their relationship with Little Weaver, including payment, will be governed by a specific contract.
