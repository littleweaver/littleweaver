Little Weaver Web Collective, LLC Policies
==========================================

Work
----

Each member must work a minimum of 40 hours per four-week pay period. Work hours include:

* work for clients,
* Collective projects,
* blog posts,
* relevant professional development (e.g., learning new software),
* and work on Collective infrastructure and overhead.

Members may not work more than 60 hours per week, because life outside of work is also important.

Pay periods are four weeks long, starting on a Monday and ending on a Sunday. Pay periods are a part of the fiscal year in which they end. Paychecks will be cut no sooner than the weekly meeting following the end of a pay period, and no later than the Wednesday following the end of the pay period. (There is a delay between when the online request is made and when the checks are actually mailed; this is not accounted for in this policy.)

Income
------

Income is split in the following fashion: 25% always remains in the Collective to cover shared expenses. 75% is distributed to the members as follows, with any excess returning to the Collective:

The Collective will keep running totals of how many hours each member has worked and how much income the Collective has received. At the end of every four-week pay period, each member will receive pay up to the least of the following:

* the difference, if at least $25, between earnings to-date (calculation detailed below) and pay to-date,
* and $75,000 in a fiscal year, calculated pro rata each pay period.

The calculation for individual earnings to-date in a fiscal year is:

    total hours worked by individual
    --------------------------------- * 0.75 * gross Collective income
    total hours worked by all members

In the event that pay for at least one member is negative, the appropriate positive pay for any members will be paid, if possible, out of the 25% of income reserved for the collective.

Client Work
-----------

### Rates

Rates will be negotiated with every client and written into their contract. The Collectiveâ€™s base rate is $100 per hour. Retained hours will be billed at a 20% discount. Emergency hours (as defined in the contract) are billed at 125% of the standard rate. All work qualifies for these rates, including time spent writing emails, giving trainings, and attending meetings. Code running on a production server will never be intentionally modified or upgraded without a contract.

### Open Source

We require that clients agree that we may contribute to existing open-source projects as part of our work for the client. We require further that clients allow us to open-source as much of the code written for them as is reasonable.

Collective Projects
-------------------

Any money brought in by Collective projects will go into the same pool as income from clients.
