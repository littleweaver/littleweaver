Membership
----------

### Rights and Responsibilities

Being a member of Little Weaver Web Collective requires adherence to the Little Weaver mission and to its bylaws and policies. Adherence to individual policies may be waived for certain periods of time and on a case-by-case basis.

Membership also comes with the following rights:

* being a voting participant in collective decision-making.
* partial legal ownership of the company.
* payment in accordance with Little Weaver policies (currently sharing 80% of profits, divided by percentage of hours worked, as detailed in “Income”).

### Exit

A member does not receive any portion of the company money upon exit. Pay calculation is not affected for the period in which the member leaves.

#### Voluntary Exit

An exit is considered voluntary with four weeks notice or the approval of the current membership.

#### Expulsion

If any member fails to adhere to the Little Weaver mission and to its bylaws and policies and they are not excused by the rest of the collective, an expulsion meeting may be held. An expulsion meeting consists of two parts: a conversation between the violating member and the rest of the collective, followed by a Collective decision-making process, excluding the violating member, which determines whether to expel the violating member or excuse the violation.


Ownership and Decision Making
-----------------------------

The following are rights of members, as stated in the preceding section.

### Ownership

All members of the Collective legally have equal ownership of the Collective’s assets, but the Collective’s assets are considered to be set aside for the use by the entire Collective. Therefore, if a member leaves, they do not receive any portion of the Collective’s assets. Upon dissolution, savings will by default be divided equally among all members. For the purpose of taxation, ownership of the Collective's assets is divided equally among all members.

### Collective Decision-Making

Collective decisions are made by informal consensus consisting of bringing a proposal to all members, airing concerns, and coming to a unanimous decision. All policy is up for discussion at any time. Collective decisions include:

* adding and removing members,
* making or changing policies,
* taking on projects,
* spending the Collective’s money,
* publishing Collective projects,
* and changing the Bylaws.


Dissolution
-----------

In the event that membership votes to dissolve the company, money held by the company will be divided evenly between current members and members who voluntarily exited within the preceding six months OR divided in a way determined by current members at the time of dissolution. Members who were expelled receive no portion of this money.
