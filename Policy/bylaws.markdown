We are committed to making socially responsible choices and encouraging our clients and users to do the same. We aim to provide the best possible experience to all users, on various devices and with varying abilities. We work to prevent finances from being a barrier to accessing our skills and our time.

Our work is built on the work of others; we give back by providing high-quality, reusable, open-source code as a resource for the development of a better internet.


Membership
----------

Being a member of Little Weaver Web Collective requires adherence to the Little Weaver mission and to its bylaws and policies. Adherence to individual policies may be waived for certain periods of time and on a case-by-case basis.

Membership also comes with these rights:

* being a voting participant in collective decision-making.
* partial legal ownership of the company.
* payment in accordance with Little Weaver policies (currently sharing 80% of profits, divided by percentage of hours worked, as detailed in “Income”).


Ownership and Decision Making
-----------------------------

The following are rights of members, as stated in the preceding section.

### Ownership

All members of the Collective legally have equal ownership of the Collective’s assets, but the Collective’s assets are considered to be set aside for the use by the entire Collective. Therefore, if a member leaves, they do not receive any portion of the Collective’s assets. Upon dissolution, savings will by default be divided equally among all members.

### Collective Decision-Making

Collective decisions are made by informal consensus consisting of bringing a proposal to all members, airing concerns, and coming to a unanimous decision. All policy is up for discussion at any time. Collective decisions include:

* adding and removing members,
* making or changing policies,
* taking on projects,
* spending the Collective’s money,
* publishing Collective projects,
* and changing the Bylaws.


Dissolution
-----------

In the event that membership votes to dissolve the company, money held by the company will be divided evenly between current members and members who voluntarily exited within the preceding six months OR divided in a way determined by current members at the time of dissolution. Members who were expelled receive no portion of this money.
