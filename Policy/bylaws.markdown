Little Weaver Web Collective Bylaws
===================================

Mission Statement
-----------------

We are committed to making socially responsible choices and encouraging our clients and users to do the same. We aim to provide the best possible experience to all users, on various devices and with varying abilities. We work to prevent finances from being a barrier to accessing our skills and our time.

Our work is built on the work of others; we give back by providing high-quality, reusable, open-source code as a resource for the development of a better internet.


Ownership and Decision Making
-----------------------------

### Ownership

All members of the Collective legally have equal ownership of the Collective’s assets, but the Collective’s assets are considered to be set aside for the use by the entire Collective. Therefore, if a member leaves, they do not receive any portion of the Collective’s assets. Upon dissolution, savings will by default be divided equally among all members.

### Decision-Making

Decisions are made by informal consensus consisting of bringing a proposal to all members, airing concerns, and coming to a unanimous decision. All policy is up for discussion at any time. All major decisions of the Collective must be unanimous. Major decisions include:

* adding and removing members,
* making or changing policies,
* taking on projects,
* spending the Collective’s money,
* and publishing Collective projects.
